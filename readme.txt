The Huffman coding compression program works very simply to compress text files.
Here is the user interface:
> python huffman.py [compress/decompress] [filename]
When compressing, a file is saved as fileName + "Compressed.txt".
IT DOES NOT DELETE ORIGINAL FILE! For practical applications, the original file would of course be deleted.

When decompressing, a file is saved as original filename + "Decompressed.txt"
Example: manofthecrowd.txt => manofthecrowdCompressed.txt => manofthecrowdDecompressed.txt
